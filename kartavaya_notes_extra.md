# continual learning 
 - Forward Learning
 - Backward Learning
# catastrophic forgetting
- Humans are excellent continual learners. 
- parameters are adjusted to optimize the loss on the new task, which likely pushes these parameters away from their optimum value that was found for the earlier tasks.
# stability-plasticity dilemma 
- reduced forgetting often comes at the cost of an impaired ability to learn new information,
# Task-based versus Task-free Continual Learning
